# MyeLeuNet

## Presentation

This repository contains the code of our project **MyeLeuNet**, developed during our Data Scientist Bootcamp training (https://datascientest.com/en/data-scientist-course) at DataScientest (https://datascientest.com/).

The goal of this project is to automate the idenfication of normal and abnormal peripheral blood cells from blood smears of healthy and leukemia patients. To do so, we merged and cleared 4 datasets for a total of 77 757 images (67 616 after cleaning). We then used a Transfer Learning approach using several Convolutional Neural Networks to identify 10 final cell categories.

This project was developed by the following team :
